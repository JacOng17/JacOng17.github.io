**Book Author:** John C. Maxwell

Talking to others is more than just getting the message across...but rather how it's being received.

**Key Takeaways:**

Make Observations rather than Generalisations/Assumptions

If you talk to a man in the language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart. - Nelson Mandela

Be available for others.

People don't care how much you know until they know how much you care.

People will not always remember what you said or did, but will always remember how you made them feel.

Humility raises up others so they can be praised.

If you want to impact people, don't talk about your successes; talk about your failures.

People don’t remember what we think is important; they remember what they think is important.

Connecting with people is a two-way street. It is a dialogue, not a monologue.

Good leaders are good listeners. They listen, learn, and then lead. Listen to how it's being said & what's not being said.

Often it doesn't take a big thing to encourage or inspire others. All it takes is just a little thing that lets someone know you understand & care about them.

"Management is about persuading people to do things they do not want to do, while leadership is about inspiring people to do things they never thought they could." - Steve Jobs

Inspiration = What They Know + What They See + What They Feel

People need to KNOW you: Understand Them & are Focused on Them; & Have High Expectations of Them

People need to SEE your: Conviction; Credibility; & Character.

People need to FEEL your: Passion for the Subject & Them; Confidence in Yourself & Them; & Gratitude for Them.

Give people an Action Plan - Move from "know how" to "do now". Apply Change Teach (ACT).

Credibility is not perfection but a willingness to admit imperfection.

The only way to keep connecting with people is to live what you communicate.
